Hello and welcome to the Nushell Contributor Handbook.  Nushell, or Nu as its often called, is a modern shell written in Rust. You can learn more about Nu and how to use in the [Nu book](https://book.nushell.sh).  In this handbook, we'll be looking at how to contribute to the Nu project itself, how Nu's code is organized, and the core concepts behind its design.

Contributing to Nu will require at least some basic programmer experience, and it's helpful to have some experience with Rust. That said, we've had people contribute to Nu who have never before written a line of Rust before writing their submission. If you are interested in contributing, there's a growing community of people who would like to help you succeed.

This handbook is split into three parts:

I. The Design of Nu
II. The Implementation of Nu
III. Best practices of coding for Nu
